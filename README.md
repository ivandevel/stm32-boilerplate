Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/stm32-boilerplate

This project aims at lowering "mean time to hello world" for STM32F4xx microcontrollers development.

Includes pre-configured project files for the free version of ARM Keil IDE, startup code, standard peripheral libraries,
and simple example drivers such as: LIS3DH MEMS accelerometer driver, SPBT2632C2A Bluetooth module, PCF8574 port expander,
M24LR64 NFC memory, ADC, LEDs, buttons.

All code has been tested on STM32F4DISCOVERY kit. If using Keilv5 install 'MDK v4 Legacy Support' package available here:
http://www2.keil.com/mdk5/legacy

Specifications of the board and MCU is available in the project. For more
